# Activating Power Electronic Switches with Blockchain Validation
### The Problem Statement:
##### The whole power distribution system in the network has different entities, one of these entities has more power generation, so to make it easier we need to connect these entities with each other to make the power transfer easier.

### Solution:
The Problem can be solved accurately using the below steps:
1. Creating a whole class for each node in the power systems network.
2. Coding the logic to calculate the triggering nodes for the power distribution from one node to another node.
3. Based on the calculated result by each node all the entities are stored in the costume blockchain created.
4. Repeating the above process forever.
